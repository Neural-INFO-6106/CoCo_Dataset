# CoCo_Dataset
# Problem Statement

The task involves implementing an image captioning system using the COCO dataset. The initial steps include downloading and extracting the necessary datasets from specified URLs. Subsequently, images are displayed in a subplot, and captions are loaded from a JSON file, creating mappings of image IDs to corresponding captions for both training and validation datasets.

Various helper functions, such as image loading and preprocessing, are defined. An example of image loading and caption display is shown for clarity.

The image captioning model utilizes a pre-trained VGG16 model to extract features from images. The VGG16 model is configured with the transfer layer before the final classification layer. Transfer values are then cached for efficient processing.

Text data is tokenized using a two-step process, first converting words into integer tokens and then embedding them into smaller vectors. The dataset is prepared for training with captions converted to sequences of integer tokens.

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) decoder is created to map transfer values from the image-recognition model into sequences of integer tokens. The decoder consists of an embedding layer, followed by three GRU layers. The model is compiled using sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, considering the dataset's integer-token format.

Training progress is logged using TensorBoard, and checkpoints are saved to monitor model performance during training. The Bahdanau Attention model is employed for decoding, utilizing features extracted from the lower convolutional layer of InceptionV3.

InceptionV3 is used for preprocessing images, and the extracted features are cached. A tf.data dataset is created for efficient training. The final model predicts captions for images using a GRU RNN with attention.
